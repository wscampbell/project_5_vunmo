CS 502 Project 5 Alt.
=====================

This repository contains project code for my alternate Project 5 assignment for
CS 502 Operating Systems at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

The majority of this code is starter code for the original assignment, which 
was pulled from Brown's CS 300 class, Fundamentals of Computer Systems. 

More information can be found at the links below:

My code is the implementations of synchronized_queue.cc and vunmo-server.cc
